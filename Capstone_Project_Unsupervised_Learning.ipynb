They released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming services number of movies has decreased by more than 2000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset. Integrating this dataset with other external datasets such as IMDB rating, rotten tomatoes can also provide many interesting findings.</P>"
